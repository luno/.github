# GitHub Copilot Licence Management System

This document explains how the automated GitHub Copilot licence management system works for the Luno organisation.

## System Overview

The automated system manages GitHub Copilot licences by:

- ‚úÖ **Daily monitoring** of Copilot licence usage (every day at 9am UTC)
- ‚úÖ **Automatic reminders** for users who haven't used Copilot for **14+ days**
- ‚úÖ **Licence revocation** for users inactive for **30+ days**
- ‚úÖ **Issue tracking** with assignments to inactive users
- ‚úÖ **Automatic issue closure** when users become active again
- ‚úÖ **Duplicate prevention** to avoid multiple reminders for the same user

## System Components

The system consists of several integrated components working together:

### Required Infrastructure

- **Label**: `copilot-reminder` - Used to tag and track reminder issues
- **Repository Secret**: `COPILOT_UPDATE_TOKEN` - Personal access token used by the workflow
- **Repository Variable**: `COPILOT_REMINDER_MESSAGE` - Stores the reminder message template
- **GitHub Actions Workflow**: Automates the entire process daily

## Workflow Process

The automated workflow operates on a daily schedule and follows this process:

### Daily Execution

**Schedule**: Every day at 9am UTC via GitHub Actions cron schedule  
**Manual Trigger**: Available through the "Run workflow" button in Actions tab

### Reminder Message Content

The system uses a standardised message template *stored in a repository variable*:

*This is an automated reminder sent daily to help ensure our Copilot licences are being used effectively.*
```

## System Logic & Automation

### Timing Thresholds

The system operates on a two-stage approach:

- **14 days inactive**: First reminder issue created with helpful resources and 16-day warning
- **30 days inactive**: Licence automatically revoked and reminder issue closed
- **Schedule**: Runs every day at 9am UTC via GitHub Actions
- **Manual trigger**: Available through the "Run workflow" button
- **Auto-closure**: Issues are automatically closed when users become active again

### Issue Management Process

The system manages GitHub issues with the following behaviour:

**Issue Creation (14 days inactive):**

- Creates issues with title: "Reminder about your GitHub Copilot licence"
- Assigns issues directly to the inactive user
- Tags issues with the `copilot-reminder` label
- Includes comprehensive setup and troubleshooting resources
- Warns users about licence revocation in 16 days

**Duplicate Prevention:**

- Checks for existing open issues with the `copilot-reminder` label
- Skips users who already have an active reminder issue
- Prevents notification spam for the same user

**Automatic Issue Closure:**

- **When users become active**: Issues are closed with a celebratory comment
- **When licences are revoked**: Issues are closed with a revocation notice
- Maintains a clean issue tracker with current status

## User Journey Examples

### Scenario 1: User Becomes Active

- **Day 1**: User gets assigned Copilot licence
- **Day 14**: User hasn't used licence ‚Üí Reminder issue created with 16-day warning
- **Day 18**: User starts using Copilot ‚Üí Issue automatically closed with celebration message

### Scenario 2: Licence Revocation

- **Day 1**: User gets assigned Copilot licence  
- **Day 14**: User hasn't used licence ‚Üí Reminder issue created with 16-day warning
- **Day 30**: User still hasn't used licence ‚Üí Licence revoked, issue closed with notice

**Workflow Logs:**

- Detailed execution logs available in **Actions** ‚Üí workflow run ‚Üí job details
- Visual indicators: ‚úÖ (active), ‚ö†Ô∏è (inactive), ‚ÑπÔ∏è (already reminded)
- Timestamp tracking for all API calls and decisions
