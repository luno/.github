        When submitting feature requests, please follow the guidelines in this template - this helps contributors assess the request and determine if it's something that can and should be actioned.
        - Write a descriptive issue title above.
        - The golden rule is to **always open *one* issue for *one* feature request**. If you notice that your feature request actually consists of many independent features, make sure to create one new issue for each of them.
        - Ensure that you've taken a look at the latest release or commit on main. It's possible that the feature you're requesting has already been added in a more recent version of this package.
        - Search open and closed issues to ensure that the requested feature has not already been requested. If you don't find a relevant match or if you're unsure, don't hesitate to **open a new issue**.
