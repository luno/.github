        When reporting bugs, please follow the guidelines in this template. This helps identify the problem precisely and thus enables contributors to fix it faster.
        - Write a descriptive issue title above.
        - The golden rule is to **always open *one* issue for *one* bug**. If you notice several bugs and want to report them, make sure to create one new issue for each of them.
        - Ensure that you're on the latest release or commit on main. It's possible that the bug you're reporting has already been fixed in a more recent version of this package.
        - Search open and closed issues to ensure it has not already been reported. If you don't find a relevant match or if you're unsure, don't hesitate to **open a new issue**.

        To properly fix a bug, we need to identify if the bug was recently introduced, or if it was always present.
        - Please specify (if applicable) the release version you found the issue in, or the **Git commit hash** if using a development branch.

      description: |
        Describe your issue briefly. What doesn't work, and how do you expect it to work instead?
        You can format code blocks or logs with <code>\`\`\`</code> tags, on separate lines before and after the text. (Use <code>\`\`\`go</code> to add Go syntax highlighting.)
        Please do not add code examples or error messages as screenshots, but as text, this helps searching for issues and testing the code.

        List of steps or sample code that reproduces the issue. Having reproducible issues is a prerequisite for contributors to be able to solve them.

      description: |
        - A small project which reproduces the issue, with no unnecessary files included.
        - Having an MRP is appreciated by contributors to be able to reproduce the bug in the same way that you are experiencing it. When testing a potential fix for the issue, contributors will use the MRP to validate that the fix is working as intended.
        - Drag and drop a ZIP archive to upload it (max 10 MB). **Do not select another field until the project is done uploading.**
